A single station could only provide coverage to half the globe, and for a world service three would be required, though more could be readily utilised. The stations would be arranged approximately equidistantly around the earth. The stations in the chain would be linked by radio or optical beams, and thus any conceivable beam or broadcast service could be provided. The technical problems involved in the design of such stations are extremely interesting, but only a few can be gone into here. Batteries of parabolic reflectors would be provided, of apertures depending on the frequencies employed.
